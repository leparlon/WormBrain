name="WormBrain"
description="A plugin that allows you to add a artificial worm to your game project. The worms AI is powered by a fully mapped nematode brain (probably as close as we can feasibily get of a real animal brain in a game). This is a little more then a conversion from javascript to GD script (and Godot Node structure) from this project https://github.com/heyseth/worm-sim"
